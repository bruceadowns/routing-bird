 * Annotation that identifies how to convert a type to a string. This can be specified with either an instance method that converts an object to its primitive
 * (ultimately string) representation, or else a TypeStringify class that performs this operation. Only one value should be specified. When applied to a class,
 * applies to the class itself; when applied to a method, applies to the method's return type.
